what is this?
yo. i got bored and decided to see if i could make roblox npcs actually smart. this is just a dumping ground for my ai pathfinding/behavior scripts.
it connects to external apis (sometimes) or just uses raw luau math to fake intelligence. honestly? i don't know how it works half the time but it looks cool.
features
🧠 big brain logic: npcs don't walk into walls (mostly).
⚡ fast af: optimized so your toaster pc doesn't explode.
🗣️ chat capabilities: they might talk back to you.
🎨 clean code: (ok i lied, it's messy but it works).
